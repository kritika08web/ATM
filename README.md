# ATM
This project simulates basic ATM functionalities using Python for the front-end logic and MySQL for the back-end database management. The system allows users to manage their accounts by performing operations such as credit (deposit) and debit (withdraw) transactions, with the account balance updated accordingly. It demonstrates integration between Python and MySQL to handle user data and transactions efficiently.
